## 1.1 Placing your collection at the Rose Library

We understand that making the decision to place your materials in an archival repository can be an emotional and, sometimes, difficult process.  For many donors, this can represent "letting go" or ceding control of a lifetime of work and memories.  You'll have many questions throughout this process, and the staff of the Rose Library are here to answer those questions.  The donation of your papers initiates an ongoing and long-term relationship between you and library staff, and we will work together to ensure your trust and confidence in our stewardship of your or your loved one’s legacy.

There are many good reasons to donate your papers to the Rose Library.  Our environmental controls and secure storage will ensure the long-term preservation of the collection.  Emory's new, state-of-the-art Library Service Center provides secure storage at the optimum temperature and relative humidity for paper materials.<a href="#anchor1"><sup>1</sup></a> It also includes a cold storage vault for special format materials, such as film, that require additional preservation measures.  Our archivists will apply professional standards to the organization and description of the material, making them easily accessible to researchers and to you.  Even though the collection will be stored physically at the Rose Library, you will never lose access to the materials as the creator, and our staff will do whatever they can to facilitate access to the collection when you need it.  Archivists also ensure proper care and handling during use of the materials in the reading room, which prevents damage to the collection, and allow researchers access far into the future.  For example, the Rose Library requires patrons to wear cotton gloves when examining unsleeved photographs.  The gloves prevent the oils on our hands from damaging the photograph's emulsion and degrading the image.  Finally, our outreach staff will promote use of the collection by students, scholars, and community members and communicate the historical value of the collection to the public.

If you're interested in placing your papers at the Rose Library, please contact us at rose.library@emory.edu and we will refer you to the proper curator.

leader and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient).

## 1.2 What is an archives?

An archives is an institution that collects, preserves, and makes accessible the archival collections of individuals, families, and organizations. By making these collections available to our researchers well into the future, we support continued scholarship and learning.

## 1.3 What is a collection?

* Your archival collection consists of the material that you have created and collected over the course of your life such as correspondence, financial records, photographs, home movies, and creative works. These document the broad spectrum of your experience, including your work, your family and relationships, and your other interests.  
* An archival collection is established based on provenance, or, the relationships between a set of documents and the individual, community, or organization that created, collected, or owned them.
* There may be a wide range of formats amongst your archival collection, including papers and printed material, audio and visual material, and born-digital material.
