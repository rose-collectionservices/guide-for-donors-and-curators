# Getting started

Once you have made the decision to place your materials with the Rose Library, our curators and archivists will be available to guide you through the process of physically transferring your collection. 

* [2.1 Initial planning](#21-initial-planning)
* [2.2 Paperwork](#22-paperwork)
* [2.3 Physical transfer](#23-physical-transfer)

## 2.1 Initial planning

As part of this process, our curators and archivists will meet with you to to look more thoroughly at your materials and discuss any of your questions and concerns. At this point, you should consider:

* Necessary access restrictions: Providing our researchers with access to these valuable materials is central to our mission at the Rose Library, but we are also mindful that your collection may include private or sensitive information that youâ€™d prefer not to be made immediately accessible in our reading room. At this stage in the process, we can discuss how we might impose restrictions and on what kinds of materials.
* Disposition: Use this time to discuss how you would like us to deal with any duplicate materials or other extraneous items that our archivists may find during later processing. Additionally, there may be materials that you don't want us to have.  Our curators and archivists will discuss disposition of these materials with you.  We can return them after the collection is processed, or we can have them confidentially shredded on your behalf.
* Digital files or media: At this stage, you should also consider whether you wish to include any digital files or media as part of your collection. Such materials can form an integral part of your archival collection, but their transfer may need to be addressed separately from your physical materials. Be sure to discuss this with our curators who, together with our digital archivist, will be glad to go over your options and answer any questions.

## 2.2 Paperwork

In order to transfer custody of your materials into our care, we will also ask you to sign some paperwork that details the conditions of the transfer. Paperwork will vary slightly, depending on the conditions of transfer. Our Accessioning and Collections Manager will be available to explain any details and answer any questions that may come up in your review of the paperwork.

## 2.3 Physical transfer

Once all paperwork has been signed and returned to us, we will work with you to arrange for the physical transfer of your materials. Typically, a curator and archivist/s will visit your home or office and pack your materials into boxes that will then be shipped back to the Rose Library. You may also have the option to pack and ship your materials to us yourself; if you would like to do that, our Accessioning and Collections Manager can guide you through the process. If your collection will include copies of digital files presently stored on a computer that you still use, you will be contacted by one of our digital archivists to discuss transfer options.
