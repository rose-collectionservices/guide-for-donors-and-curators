# 3.1 Special considerations for born-digital material

If you’ve been actively creating content in the past thirty years, it’s likely that your archival collection will include born-digital material—that is, documents and records created using a computer. These materials are subject to the same principles that guide all archival work, regardless of format. No matter what a collection contains—whether papers, photographs, sound recordings, or digital data—archivists are concerned with ensuring the authenticity of those objects (in other words, taking steps to prevent any inadvertent change), and with tracking and delivering information about their history and the context in which they were created and used. Applied collectively, these principles play a crucial role in preserving the value of these collections as cultural records of a moment or place in history.

All this being said, the nature of born-digital materials in particular demands some extra special handling in order to adhere to the principles set out above. This is because, unlike a handwritten letter or the pages of a book, born-digital data must be mediated through some combination of hardware and software. You cannot view the bits and bytes that make up your Microsoft Word document directly. Rather you need a copy of Microsoft Office running on a compatible operating system running on compatible hardware, and so on. These multiple dependencies add a layer of complexity to the transfer process, especially given that these intermediary pieces of hardware and software can alter data if we don’t take certain precautions. 

Our curators and digital archivists will discuss this process with you and will be available to answer any questions that you may have. We want to ensure that we plan for the transfer of your born-digital materials in such a way that:

1.	Aligns with the guiding archival principles outlined above, and; 
2.	Facilitates long-term preservation and our ability to provide ongoing access to researchers.

The first step in accomplishing this will involve a conversation with our digital archivist about what kinds of born-digital materials you have and where. We know that sharing born-digital material can feel especially personal and recognize that your digital data—like your other collection materials—may include confidential or sensitive information. We will work closely with you to determine if and where material needs to be restricted.
