## 4.1 Accessioning

Following its arrival at the Rose Library, archivists will "accession" the collection.  Accessioning is the formal process by which the Library takes possession of the material.  During this process, we ensure that all of the required paper work, such as deeds of gift or sale, is signed and on file, assign the material a unique collection number, document the contents and the volume of the collection, and make note of any special conditions, such as restrictions.

## 4.2 Arrangement

After accessioning, archivists will process the collection, providing basic physical and intellectual access to the material, so it can be immediately opened for research.  The level of detail provided will vary by a collection’s size and how much detail is needed to facilitate the collections’s use.  If the collection is small or straightforward, archivists may provide greater or more granular detail about the collection. For larger, complex collections, access will likely be a box level inventory.  

Any material identified as sensitive will be physically segregated and restricted from use by researchers.  Archivists do not review every document in a collection for sensitive material, but will make our best efforts to identify where this information is most likely to be found and remove it from the collection.

During processing, archivists and curators may contact you with questions about the material, additional/updated restrictions, or returning duplicate material.  We appreciate the insights our donors can provide to the material and view our relationship with you as one of ongoing collaboration.

Some collections may be described with a box level inventory initially, but later become a candidate for more granular or detailed arrangement.  Each year, processing priorities are determined by the Rose Library's leadership team based on use in the reading room, available staff time, and other criteria.  Priorities can shift over time.  Our goal is to make every collection available to patrons as quickly as possible following acquisition, providing accurate and adequate arrangement and description to facilitate use.  We then provide additional arrangement and description as needed to improve access and promote use of our holdings.

## 4.3 Description

A finding aid will be written and published online.  It will describe the contents of the collection and the overall arrangement devised by the archivist.  A finding aid is a researcher's primary point of access to a collection.  It always includes a brief biographical or historical note describing the creator of the records, as well as a scope and content note that describes the contents of the collection.  Scope and content notes often contain information about the formats present in the collection, as well as significant topics, names, and events documented in the records.  They do not interpret the historical value or meaning of the collection.

Once the finding aid is written, the archivist will share the document with you.  We welcome questions, corrections, and feedback.  At any time significant changes are made, primarily when further arrangement and description is conducted on the collection, the archivist will share the updated version of the finding aid with you.

## 4.4 Use

Following publication of the finding aid, the collection will be available for use by anyone in our reading room.  Patrons will use the collection in a secure, supervised space and are required to observe our rules for care and handling of rare material.  The Rose Library is open to anyone with an interest in our holdings.
