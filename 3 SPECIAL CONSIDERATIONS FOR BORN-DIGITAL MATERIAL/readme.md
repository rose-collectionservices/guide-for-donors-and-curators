## 3.1 Special considerations for born-digital material

If you’ve been actively creating content in the past thirty years, it’s likely that your archival collection will include born-digital material—that is, documents and records created using a computer. These materials are subject to the same principles that guide all archival work, regardless of format. No matter what a collection contains—whether papers, photographs, sound recordings, or digital data—archivists are concerned with ensuring the authenticity of those objects (in other words, taking steps to prevent any inadvertent change), and with tracking and delivering information about their history and the context in which they were created and used. Applied collectively, these principles play a crucial role in preserving the value of these collections as cultural records of a moment or place in history.

All this being said, the nature of born-digital materials in particular demands some extra special handling in order to adhere to the principles set out above. This is because, unlike a handwritten letter or the pages of a book, born-digital data must be mediated through some combination of hardware and software. You cannot view the bits and bytes that make up your Microsoft Word document directly. Rather you need a copy of Microsoft Office running on a compatible operating system running on compatible hardware, and so on. These multiple dependencies add a layer of complexity to the transfer process, especially given that these intermediary pieces of hardware and software can alter data if we don’t take certain precautions. 

Our curators and digital archivists will discuss this process with you and will be available to answer any questions that you may have. We want to ensure that we plan for the transfer of your born-digital materials in such a way that:

1.	Aligns with the guiding archival principles outlined above, and; 
2.	Facilitates long-term preservation and our ability to provide ongoing access to researchers.

The first step in accomplishing this will involve a conversation with our digital archivist about what kinds of born-digital materials you have and where. We know that sharing born-digital material can feel especially personal and recognize that your digital data—like your other collection materials—may include confidential or sensitive information. We will work closely with you to determine if and where material needs to be restricted.

## 3.2 Selecting file formats for long-term preservation and access

While the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Books Library places no restrictions on the types of files that we collect, we do acknowledge that certain file formats are better suited to long-term preservation and access than others. Generally speaking, these file formats are open-source, widely-used, and are either uncompressed or use lossless compression.

### 3.2.1 Why are open-source file formats better for long-term preservation and access?

Every file format has a set of specifications detailing how it is encoded and how it is interpreted by the appropriate software. In cases where file formats are owned and managed commercially, these specifications may not be openly available to the public. As a result, continued access to proprietary file formats depends on ongoing support from the organization that develops and manages them. When support for a format ends due to changing priorities at the organization or because the organization goes out of business, lack of access to the format specifications increase the risk of that format becoming obsolete. In contrast, organizations or communities committed to maintaining open-source formats make specifications and other related documentation openly available to users. What’s more, these formats are often compatible with multiple software platforms.

The Rose Library does not recommend use of proprietary file formats, as these formats may become difficult or impossible to access in the future. Examples of proprietary file formats include Photoshop's .PSD files and Paint Shop Pro's .PSP files (for still images) and RealMedia's .RM files (for audio files).

### 3.2.2 How does compression affect long-term preservation and access? 

In order to maximize storage space, some file formats use compression algorithms to identify data that can be removed from the file at negligible cost to the end-user and thereby reduce the overall file size. Files are compressed in one of two ways, using either lossless or lossy compression. Lossless compression is reversible, as it removes data without discarding it. This allows for reduced file size without compromising the quality of the file. In contrast, lossy compression removes and discards data every time the file is saved. This means that the quality of a file using lossy compression is affected with each new copy or change.

### 3.2.3 File format recommendations

These factors, along with requirements as to which file formats are and are not compatible with our digital repository, inform the following recommendations:

#### Digital photographs and other still image files:

**Best File Formats:**    

* High-resolution, uncompressed TIFF file (preferably 400 dpi or higher) [*.tif, *.tiff]                                                              

**Good Enough File Formats:**   

* JPEG2000 Lossless [*.jp2] 
* JPEG [*.jpg, *.jpeg] (If the photographer typically shoots in JPEG, we will transfer those JPEG images. Otherwise an alternative format may be preferable.)                                                        

**Poor File Formats:**   

* RAW Output (RAW digital camera images are sometimes large and often proprietary. A RAW file cannot be used as an image; an image file must be created from the data in order to view and edit the image.) 
* Any other proprietary file formats                                                                                                                                          

#### Digital audio files:

**Best File Formats:**    

* WAV (96 kHz 24 bit PCM<a href="#anchor1"><sup>1</sup></a>) [*.wav]  
* Broadcast WAV (96 kHz 24 bit PCM) [*.bwav, *.wav]                                                     
**Good Enough File Formats:**   

* AIFF (at least 44 kHz 16 bit PCM) [*.aif, *.aiff]
* WAV (44 kHz 16 bit PCM) [*.wav]      
* MP3 (MPEG-1/2, layer 3) [*.mp3]                                                

**Poor File Formats:**   

* Proprietary File Formats  

#### Digital video files:

**Best File Formats:**    

* QuickTime Movie (uncompressed, motion JPEG) [*.mov]
* Matroska file format with FFVI video encoding [*.mkv]  
* Material eXchange Format (MXF) [*.mxf]                                                   
**Good Enough File Formats:**   

* MP4 (MPEG-4) [*.mp4]                                            

**Poor File Formats:**   

* Proprietary File Formats

<a id="anchor1">[1]</a> Information regarding the file’s sampling rate and bit depth help determine the quality of the file. The sampling rate, measured in kHz, represents the number of times per second that the sound wave is captured. The bit depth represents the number of bits per sample. The higher this number, the greater the range of sounds captured. As a point of reference, CD audio files have a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and a bit depth of 16 bit.
