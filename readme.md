### About this Guide

### About the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library

The Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, & Rare Book Library collects and connects stories of human experience, promotes access and learning, and offers opportunities for dialogue for all wise hearts who seek knowledge.

Situated at the top of the Woodruff Library and in the heart of Emory’s campus, the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library is home to approximately 150,000 print titles and over 1,350 archival collections containing more than 15,000 linear feet of material (nearly three miles of boxes).

Our collections draw on five primary subject areas:

* **African American History and Culture:** Documents political and social movements, literature and the arts, sports, and black print culture.
* **Modern Political and Historical Collections:** Document the history, culture, and politics of Atlanta, Georgia, and the South, particularly political activism and social reform of the women’s, Civil Rights, and LGBT movements.
* **Literary Collections and the Raymond Danowski Poetry Library:** Focuses in particular on southern, African American, and Irish writing, and modern and contemporary poetry. 
* **Rare Books:** Includes books and serials dating from the 13th century to the present.
* **Emory University Archives:** Documents the origins, history, development, activities, and achievements of Emory University and affiliated organizations.

The collections at the Rose Library are available to anyone, from the serious academic researcher to the simply curious. Designed to facilitate public programs and exhibitions, the Rose Library fosters engaging conversations about literature and art, social change and human rights, religion and culture, and science and medicine.  

“Every collection in the Rose Library tells a story—of a family, an organization, an artist, a historical experience, or a literary movement,” says Rosemary Magee, former director of the Rose Library. “Through the study of primary evidence embedded in the manuscripts, photographs, letters, archives, and rare books, students and scholars create knowledge that inspires a deeper understanding of what it means to be human.”
